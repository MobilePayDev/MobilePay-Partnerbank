# MobilePay PartnerBank API Documentation
This document describes the call structure to query PartnerBank API of MobilePay. The API is designed to be called by an integrator (ex. data center), representing a bank. The focal purpose of the API is to provide partnerbanks with data in order to monitor if and how their merchants are using MobilePay. 

Integrator needs to inform about GitHub username, in order to be invited to the documentation repository with read rights

This document is meant to be used by the developers integrating into the API.

## Request headers
After onboarding to https://developer.mobilepay.dk and creating an App, use the given `X-IBM-Client-Id` and `X-IBM-Client-Secret` as request headers when calling the API. 

To specify which bank you are representing during this call, add the Bank-Identifier-Code header. The header format is AAAABBCC:
- AAAA - identifies a bank;
- BB - identifies the country of the bank;
- CC - location code for head office.

| Header Key           | Description                                                         |
| -------------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-IBM-Client-Id`      | Client-Id of your App created in https://developer.mobilepay.dk     |
| `X-IBM-Client-Secret`  | Client-Secret of your App created in https://developer.mobilepay.dk |
| Bank-Identifier-Code | 8 symbol BIC                                                        |

Your `X-IBM-Client-Secret` will only be displayed once. If you forget or lose it, you can verify the secret to see if itâ€™s correct or reset it to get a new one.
